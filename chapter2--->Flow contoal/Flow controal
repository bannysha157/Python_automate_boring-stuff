1)1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
sln: True and False, using capital T and F, with the rest of the word in lowercase

 2)What are the three Boolean operators?
 sln: AND, OR, and NOT
 
 3)Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).
  sln:   AND 0 0 0
            0 1  0
            1  0  0
             1  1  1     
         OR
         0 0 0
         0 1 1
         1 0  1
         1 1  1
         NOT
         0 1
         1 0
 
 
 4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 > 4)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)


sln:False
False
True
False
False
True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
sln:==, !=, <, >, <=, and >=


6)What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?
sln: == is the equal to operator that compares two values and evaluates to a Boolean, 
while = is the assignment operator that stores a value in a variable.


7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.
sln:7. A condition is an expression used in a flow control statement that evaluates to a Boolean value.


8)Identify the three blocks in this code:

spam = 0
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')
    if spam > 5:
        print('bacon')
    else:
        print('ham')
    print('spam')
print('spam')

sln:    The  three blocks are everything inside the if statement and the lines print('bacon') and print('ham').
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
    print('bacon')
else:
    print('ham')
print('spam')


9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

sln:if spam == 1:
    print('Hello')
elif spam == 2:
    print('Howdy')
else:
    print('Greetings!')
 
 
 10. What keys can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?
 sln:Press CTRL-C to stop a program stuck in an infinite loop.


11). What is the difference between break and continue?
   sln:The break statement will move the execution outside and just after a loop. 
   The continue statement will move the execution to the start of the loop.
   
 12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?
   sln:They all do the same thing. The range(10) call ranges from 0 up to (but not including) 10, range(0, 10) 
   explicitly tells the loop to start at 0, and r
   ange(0, 10, 1) explicitly tells the loop to increase the variable by 1 on each iteration.
   
   for i in renge(0,10)              for i in range(10)                  
   print(i)                            print(i)
   o/p=0                                o/p=0
1                                           1
2                                           2
3                                           3
4                                           4
5                                           5
6                                           6
7                                           7
8                                           8
9                                           9
                                          
 
 13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop.
 Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

sln:The code:
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)

and:

i = 1
while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1


14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?

sln:This function can be called with spam.bacon().
